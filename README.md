# Linear Regression Analysis Project

This project undertakes a thorough exploration and analysis of a dataset to develop linear regression models aimed at uncovering variables that may significantly impact the target outcome. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) leverages Python libraries including Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, while the linear regression models are implemented exclusively with Numpy. This report presents a discussion of the EDA methods, the process of model construction, and the evaluation of model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is contributed by Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression).
